The idea of AR/VR being the most in-demand software engineering position is no surprise, given the huge success of Pokemon GO, and VR headsets like Oculus and Vive becoming more accessible to the general public. What I do find intersting however, is the economics behind the claim that the demand for AR/VR engineers is outweighing that of supply. In a simple model, equilibrium would be reached by raising the prices, or in this case, higher pay for AR/VR engineers. Yet, later in the article, it's mentioned that engineers have been looking for ways to self-teach the additional skills needed for AR/VR programming, implying that your typical Computer Science graduate doesn't not have an adequate skillset to be hired for AR/VR programming.
